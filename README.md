## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

* Java 8+ or OpenJDK 1.8 (recommended)
* Maven 3.6+
* A relational database (H2 in-memory default, or switch to PostgreSQL/MySQL) (or you can use the docker files)

### Run the App

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourorg/java-springboot.git
cd java-springboot
mvn clean spring-boot:run
```

The app starts on `http://localhost:8080`

## 🌟 Feature Highlights

### ✅ Entity Modeling

* `Product` and `Category` use:

  * `@NotBlank`, `@Size`, `@Future`, `@Email`, etc.
  * Cascade types with warnings on dangerous usage
  * Fetch strategies (`EAGER`, `LAZY`) with N+1 explanation
  * Bidirectional relationships with serialization control (`@JsonManagedReference`, `@JsonIgnore`)

### ✅ Repository Layer

* Derived query methods
* JPQL with `@Query`
* Pagination and sorting with `Pageable`
* Safe parameter naming with `@Param("customName")`
* Entity graph loading with `@EntityGraph`

## 📌 Upcoming Enhancements

### ☑️ To-Do Features

* Service Layer: abstraction and transactional orchestration
* DTOs: decoupled API models with validation
* REST Controllers: endpoints with `@Valid` and exception handling
* Error Handling: global `@ControllerAdvice`
* Swagger/OpenAPI docs
* Docker Compose for DB setup
* Unit and integration testing
* CI/CD pipeline with GitHub Actions

See `TODO.md` for the complete roadmap.
