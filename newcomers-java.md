# Java Newcomers Guide (Interview & Practice Edition)

Welcome to the Java side of this monorepo! This guide is designed for both beginners and those preparing for interviews, with a focus on hands-on learning and real-world application.

---

## 1. Key Directories & What You'll Find

- **src/main/java/com/**: Business logic for the e-commerce and loan management system (Spring Boot based)
- **src/main/java/dsa/**: Data structures and algorithms—great for interview prep and Java fundamentals
- **src/main/java/leetcode/**: LeetCode and coding challenge solutions
- **test/java/**: Unit and integration tests for both business and DSA code

---

## 2. Core Java Concepts to Master (with Examples)

- **OOP Principles**: Classes, objects, inheritance, polymorphism, encapsulation, abstraction
  - See: `ParentChildTest.java`, `ParentChildTest2.java`, `BuilderPatternOrder.java`
- **Collections Framework**: Lists, Sets, Maps, Queues, Stacks
  - See: `ArrayListBST.java`, `MapsExample.java`, `CustomLinkedList.java`
- **Exception Handling**: try-catch, custom exceptions, checked vs unchecked
  - See: `exception/` package in business logic, and DSA examples
- **Threads & Concurrency**: Thread creation, synchronization, deadlocks
  - See: `ThreadingExample.java`, `DeadlockExample.java`, `LocksExample.java`
- **Streams & Lambdas**: Functional programming in Java 8+
  - See: `StreamExample.java`, `StreamExamples.java`
- **String Manipulation**: String methods, immutability, performance
  - See: `StringMethodsExample.java`

---

## 3. Interview-Oriented Practice

- **DSA Folder**: Practice classic data structures (linked lists, trees, stacks, queues) and algorithms (sorting, searching, recursion)
- **LeetCode Folder**: Real-world coding problems, often asked in interviews
- **Patterns**: Builder, Singleton, Factory, etc. (see `BuilderPatternOrder.java`)
- **Java Language Features**: Practice with generics, enums, annotations, and inner classes

---

## 4. Best Practices for Java Development

- Follow Java naming conventions (`CamelCase` for classes, `camelCase` for variables/methods)
- Keep classes focused and methods short
- Use interfaces and abstract classes for extensibility
- Prefer immutability where possible (use `final`)
- Avoid magic numbers/strings—use constants
- Write JavaDocs for public classes and methods
- Use unit tests to verify logic (see `test/java/`)
- Clean up unused code and imports before committing

---

## 5. Getting Started & Workflow

1. **Setup**: Install JDK 11+ and an IDE (IntelliJ IDEA or Eclipse recommended)
2. **Build**: Use Maven wrapper (`mvnw.cmd clean install`)
3. **Run Tests**: `mvnw.cmd test`
4. **Explore**: Start with simple DSA classes, then move to business logic
5. **Practice**: Try modifying DSA/LeetCode examples or add your own

---

## 6. Interview Tips

- Be able to explain OOP concepts with code examples
- Practice writing and debugging code without an IDE (for whiteboard interviews)
- Know the time/space complexity of your solutions
- Be comfortable with Java 8+ features (lambdas, streams, Optionals)
- Review exception handling and custom exceptions
- Practice multi-threading basics and common pitfalls (deadlocks, race conditions)
